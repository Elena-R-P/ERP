## ePortfolio Computer Science Capstone
This repository contains my ePortfolio and a final project for CS-499 Computer Science Capstone course, which documents my experience over the past few years. The ePortfolio content provides a solid starting point for develoiping ideas that demonstrate my skills in key areas of Computer Science. The included artifacts from some of the Computer Science courses reflect my growth in key categories: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structure, and Databases. The ePortfolio highlights a selected area of specialization in computer science and shows programming skills within that specialization. In ePortfolio, I demonstrated my experience with the Django web framework, Python programming skills, MySQL database, and frontend technologies.

### Software Design and Engineering Enhancement
**[Software Design and Engineering Narrative](https://github.com/Elena-R-P/ERP/blob/master/cs499/m3_2_software_design.pdf)**
</br>
For the Software Engineering and Design category, I have demonstrated the ability to gather requirements for a new system, determine necessary functionality, and use innovative technical skills and tools to develop a software application that solves a given problem. 
### Algorithms and Data Structure Enhancement
**[Algorithms and Data Structure Narrative](https://github.com/Elena-R-P/ERP/blob/master/cs499/m4_2_algorithms.pdf)**
</br>
In the algorithms and data structure category, I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs.
### Databases Enhancement
**[Databases Narrative](https://github.com/Elena-R-P/ERP/blob/master/cs499/m5_2_databases.pdf)**
</br>
For the Databases category, I demonstrated the ability to use innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.
